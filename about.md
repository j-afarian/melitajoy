    <p>Melita Joy's life has always been eventful. Having ridden wonderful highs and suffered tremendous setbacks,
      her outlook has always been: I'll write about this one day!
      The creation of Gisella was cathartic in providing the opportunity to explore topics close to Melita's heart.</p>

    <p>When she is not writing, she loves spending time with her husband--whom she calls Mr. Romance himself--and their six
      adult children. Melita and her family reside in Sydney, Australia.</p>

    <p>Please visit her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melitajoy.australia">Facebook page</a>, the more, the merrier and feel free to have a conversation with Melita.
      She loves to chat almost as much as she loves to write.</p>

      <p>Happy reading,<br>
        Melita Joy</p>
